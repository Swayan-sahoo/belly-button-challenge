# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project visualizes the diversity of bacterial species found in human belly buttons. It provides an interactive dashboard where users can explore microbial data collected from different individuals' belly button samples. The dashboard displays key insights into the samples, including metadata and bacterial cultures, in both bar and bubble chart formats.

## Features
- **Dropdown Menu**: Select a test subject ID to display related data.
- **Metadata Panel**: Displays demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Bubble Chart**: Interactive chart visualizing all bacteria in a sample.
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 bacteria found in the sample, ranked by prevalence.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** (D3.js, Plotly.js) – For dynamic data visualization.
- **HTML** – Basic page structure.
- **CSS** – Styling for the layout and charts.
- **JSON** – Dataset for bacterial diversity.
- **GitHub Pages** – To deploy the project online.
